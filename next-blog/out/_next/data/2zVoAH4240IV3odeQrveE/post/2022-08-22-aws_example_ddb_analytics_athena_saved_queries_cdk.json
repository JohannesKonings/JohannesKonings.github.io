This is useful to have important queries prepared for any users.","categories":"aws","thumbnail":"aws_kinesis","tags":["aws","aws athena","aws cdk"]},"content":"In [this]({{ site.baseurl }}/aws/2021/08/27/aws_example_ddb_analytics/) post is a example of a Athena query to get the the current data of the DynamoDb table.\n\nThis post explains how to provide this query with CDK as a saved query in Athena to have the query stored \"nearby\" the editor and that the query fits to the current deployment regarding the naming of the DB and table.\nAnother advantage is to have the query under source control.\n\nThis is a extension of [this]({{ site.baseurl }}/aws/2021/10/26/aws_example_ddb_analytics_cdk/) post.\n\nThe saved queries are stored here in the console:\n\n![athena save queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2022-08-22-aws_example_ddb_analytics_athena_saved_queries_cdk/athena_saved_queries.png)\n\n# The SQL command\n\nThis SQL command will be provided as a saved query in Athena. For easier maintenance, the command is in an extra [SQL file](https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk/blob/main/cdk/lib/saved-queries/ddb-state.sql).\nThe DB and the table name are placeholders in the file and will be replaced during the deployment process. That ensures that this SQL command refers to the correct resources, which are also deployed.\n\n```sql\nSELECT dynamodb.newimage.pk.s AS pk,\n        dynamodb.newimage.person.M.firstname.s AS firstname,\n        dynamodb.newimage.person.M.lastname.s AS lastname,\n        dynamodb.approximatecreationdatetime AS ts,\n        dynamodb.newimage,\n        *\nFROM \"athenaDbName\".\"athenaTableName\" AS persons1\nWHERE (eventname = 'INSERT'\n        OR eventname = 'MODIFY')\n        AND dynamodb.approximatecreationdatetime =\n    (SELECT MAX(dynamodb.approximatecreationdatetime)\n    FROM \"athenaDbName\".\"athenaTableName\" AS persons2\n    WHERE persons2.dynamodb.newimage.pk.s = persons1.dynamodb.newimage.pk.s);\n```\n\n\n# Saved Query Construct\n\nLike the SQL file, the CDK definition of the saved query is in an [extra](https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk/blob/main/cdk/lib/saved-queries/saved-queries.ts)[ file](https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk/blob/main/cdk/lib/saved-queries/saved-queries.ts) as a CDK construct.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { Construct } from 'constructs'\nimport {\n  aws_athena as athenaCfn\n} from 'aws-cdk-lib'\nimport * as glue from '@aws-cdk/aws-glue-alpha'\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nexport interface SavedQueriesProps {\n  glueDb: glue.IDatabase;\n  athenaTableName: string;\n  athenaWorkgroupName: string;\n}\n\nexport class SavedQueries extends Construct {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: SavedQueriesProps) {\n    super(scope, id)\n\n    const getSqlString = (file: string): string => {\n      let personsDdbStateSqlCommand = readFileSync(join(__dirname, `${file}`), 'utf-8').toString()\n      const athenaDbName = props.glueDb.databaseName\n      let athenaTableName = props.athenaTableName;\n      athenaTableName = athenaTableName.replace(/-/g, '_')\n      personsDdbStateSqlCommand = personsDdbStateSqlCommand.replace(/athenaDbName/g, athenaDbName)\n      personsDdbStateSqlCommand = personsDdbStateSqlCommand.replace(/athenaTableName/g, athenaTableName)\n      return personsDdbStateSqlCommand\n    }\n\n    let queryString = getSqlString('ddb-state.sql')\n\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-new\n    new athenaCfn.CfnNamedQuery(this, 'query-current-ddb-state', {\n      database: props.glueDb.databaseName,\n      queryString: queryString,\n      description: 'query the current state from the ddb table',\n      name: 'current-ddb-state',\n      workGroup: props.athenaWorkgroupName\n    })\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCurrently, there is no L2 Construct for a named query in CDK, so it is defined as a L1 CFN Resource (`CfnNamedQuery`).\n\nThis needs the query as a string. The function `getSqlString` converts and transforms the SQL file content to that needed string.\n\nSo that the placeholders are replaced with the resources, which are deployed.\n\nThe Athena table name will be created during the glue crawler process. The convention is that the table name configured prefix of the S3 bucket with an underscore (\"_\") instead of dashes (\"-\").\n\nThe database name and the workgroup name are passed from the stack to the construct.\n\n# Insert the saved query construct in the stack\n\nFor the deployment the saved queries construct will be inserted into the [stack](https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk/blob/main/cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts#L211)\n\nThe needed information are passed as props to the construct.\n\nThe saved queries are depending on the workgroup. That has to be defined in CDK. Otherwise, the deployment will fail.\n\n```typescript\nconst savedQueries = new SavedQueries(this, 'saved-queries', {\n      glueDb: glueDb,\n      athenaTableName: firehoseBucketName,\n      athenaWorkgroupName: athenaWorkgroup.name,\n    })\n\n    savedQueries.node.addDependency(athenaWorkgroup);\n```\n\n\n# Result\nAfter the deployment, the new query is listed here and can be chosen for query in the editor.\n\n![athena save query deployed]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2022-08-22-aws_example_ddb_analytics_athena_saved_queries_cdk/athena_saved_query_deployed.png)\n\n![athena save queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2022-08-22-aws_example_ddb_analytics_athena_saved_queries_cdk/athena_saved_query_editor.png)\n\n# Code\n\n[https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk](https://github.com/JohannesKonings/test-aws-dynamodb-athena-cdk)\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
